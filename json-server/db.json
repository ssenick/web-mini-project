            "There are other ways to run JS code in the browser. So, if we talk about the usual use of JavaScript programs, they are loaded into the browser to ensure the operation of web pages. As a rule, the code is formatted in the form of separate files with the .js extension, which connect to web pages, but program code can also be included directly in the page code. This is all done using the <script> tag. When the browser encounters such code, it executes it. For more information about the script tag, see w3school.com. In particular , let's look at an example demonstrating how to work with a web page using JavaScript, given on this resource. This example can also be run using this resource (look for the Try it Yourself button), but we will do it a little differently.
